Thanks for your patience
------------------------
First of all, I'd like to thank all xoopsers for your patience with Soapbox. This module has taught me many, many things, and has given me many, many headaches, but I can truly say my knowledge of PHP and MySQL has grown giant steps in the past couple of months. My respect for XOOPS original developer, Kazumi Ono, has also grown a lot. This is a very smart and very powerful piece of software.

-------------
Introduction:
-------------
Thanks for giving Soapbox an opportunity to serve you. This little module has a single purpose: to help you build in your site an editorial column section, where you can manage the columns and articles published in an ordered fashion.

This module was built using XOOPS 2.0.6 as test bed. It's based on Catzwolf's module called WF-FAQ, with what we could say a lot of changes. But it does have its main features: uses Smarty templates, can take comments, it's fully searchable, includes notification options, and lets users rate the articles as well as send private messages to the authors. Also, you can decide which groups of users see what specific columns.

This document is short because, to be honest, Soapbox includes a LARGE help file. In fact, most of the module's weight is due to the inclusion of this help file, which can be accessed through a button in the admin side. If you want a leaner module, just leave the help folder out of your upload and keep it handy to have local access to the help. Just remember that yuo won't have it available while online.

How to install
--------------
Soapbox is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /soapbox folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Soapbox icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

For a complete description of the module and its features, you can use the included help file. Access it directly in yoursite/modules/soapbox/help/soapbox.help or else use the 'Help' button in the admin side of the module. If you prefer NOT to include the help file on your server, simply open the directory "Help" on your local machine and open "soapbox.html" in your browser.

Feedback
--------
As every other man, I'd like to know if this module is useful to you, if it has bugs, if it can be in any way improved. In any of these circumstances, don't hesitate: mail me at hsalazar@xoops.org and I'll be listening to good suggestions and positive critics..
